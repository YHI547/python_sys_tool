# python_sys_tool
This is an initial project focused on building a small tool using the sys and colorama libraries.\n

This tool displays various pieces of information about your Python environment, such as:\n
- Your operating system platform\n
- The exact path of your Python executable\n
- Active system flags
- Your Python version

All of the information mentioned above is provided by the sys library, which is used for working with system-level features in Python.

The second library, colorama, is used to make the tool more visually appealing by adding colored output, which improves readability.

I hope this tool is useful for you.
